# ADB-Google-Apps-Removal-Script

**Working: Most likely, depends on your device/ROM**

Copy-and-paste solution to "uninstall" Google Apps from your Android. Tested on Samsung Note20, Android 11, OneUI 3.1.
(Note that, since /system is r/o, using this script will *not* free space on your device; it only disables the apps from running.)
